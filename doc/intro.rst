Introduction
===================================

This repository contains python exercises accompanying the book
`Neuronal Dynamics <http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/>`__ by Wulfram
Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud and Liam Paninski.
References to relevant chapters will be added in the `Teaching Materials <http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/lectures.html>`__ section of
the book homepage.

Quickstart
----------

See :ref:`the setup instructions <exercises-setup>` for details on how to install the python classes needed for the exercises.

Every :ref:`exercise <exercises-index>` comes with instructions and a demo function to get started. We recommend to create one jupyter notebook per exercise.


Brian1
------
All exercises are rewritten and use the more recent `Brian2 Simulator <https://github.com/brian-team/brian2>`__.
The old brian1 exercises are available on the `brian1 branch <https://github.com/EPFL-LCN/neuronaldynamics-exercises/tree/brian1>`__.

Requirements
------------

The following requirements should be met:

-  Either Python 2.7 or 3.4
-  `Brian2 Simulator <https://github.com/brian-team/brian2>`__ 2.0b4
-  Numpy
-  Matplotlib
-  Scipy (only required in some exercises)


If you are not using anaconda/miniconda, you can install all requirements by running:
