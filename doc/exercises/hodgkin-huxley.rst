**Book chapters**

See `Chapter 2 Section 2 <Chapter_>`_ on general information about
the Hodgkin-Huxley equations and models.

**Python classes**

The :mod:`.hodgkin_huxley.HH` module contains all code required for this exercise. It implements a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model.
At the beginning of your exercise solutions, import the modules and run the demo function.

.. code-block:: py

    %matplotlib inline
    import brian2 as b2
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    from neurodynex3.hodgkin_huxley import HH

   Step current injection into a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron


Exercise: step current response
-------------------------------
We study the response of a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron to different input currents. Have a look at the documentation of the functions :func:`.HH.simulate_HH_neuron` and :func:`.HH.plot_data` and the module :mod:`neurodynex3.tools.input_factory`.

Question
~~~~~~~~
What is the lowest step current amplitude :math:`I_{min}` for generating **at least one spike**? Determine the value by trying different input amplitudes in the code fragment:

.. code-block:: py

    current = input_factory.get_step_current(5, 100, b2.ms, I_min *b2.uA)
    state_monitor = HH.simulate_HH_neuron(current, 120 * b2.ms)
    HH.plot_data(state_monitor, title="HH Neuron, minimal current")

Question
~~~~~~~~
* What is the lowest step current amplitude to generate **repetitive firing**?
* Discuss the difference between the two regimes.

Exercise: slow and fast ramp current
------------------------------------
The minimal current to elicit a spike does not just depend on the amplitude :math:`I` or on the total charge :math:`Q` of the current, but on the "shape" of the current. Let's see why:


Question
~~~~~~~~
Inject a slow ramp current into a HH neuron. The current has amplitude ``0A`` at t in [0, 5] ms and linearly increases to an amplitude of ``12.0uAmp`` at ``t=ramp_t_end``. At ``t>ramp_t_end``, the current is set to ``0A``. Using the following code, reduce ``slow_ramp_t_end`` to the minimal duration of the ramp current, such that the neuron does **not** spike. Make sure you simulate system for at least 20ms after the current stops.

* What is the membrane voltage at the time when the current injection stops (``t=slow_ramp_t_end``)?

.. code-block:: py

    b2.defaultclock.dt = 0.02*b2.ms
    slow_ramp_t_end = 60  # no spike. make it shorter
    slow_ramp_current = input_factory.get_ramp_current(5, slow_ramp_t_end, b2.ms, 0.*b2.uA, 12.0*b2.uA)
    state_monitor = HH.simulate_HH_neuron(slow_ramp_current, 90 * b2.ms)
    idx_t_end = int(round(slow_ramp_t_end*b2.ms / b2.defaultclock.dt))
    voltage_slow = state_monitor.vm[0,idx_t_end]
    print("voltage_slow={}".format(voltage_slow))


Question
~~~~~~~~
Do the same as before but for a fast ramp current: The maximal amplitude at ``t=ramp_t_end`` is ``4.5uAmp``. Start with ``fast_ramp_t_end = 8ms`` and then increase it until you observe a spike.
Note: Technically the input current is implemented using a ``TimedArray``. For a short, steep ramp, the one millisecond discretization for the current is not high enough. You can create a finer resolution by setting the parameter ``unit_time`` in the function :func:`.input_factory.get_ramp_current` (see next code block).

* What is the membrane voltage at the time when the current injection stops (``t=fast_ramp_t_end``)?

.. code-block:: py

    b2.defaultclock.dt = 0.02*b2.ms
    fast_ramp_t_end = 80  # no spike. make it longer
    fast_ramp_current = input_factory.get_ramp_current(50, fast_ramp_t_end, 0.1*b2.ms, 0.*b2.uA, 4.5*b2.uA)
    state_monitor = HH.simulate_HH_neuron(fast_ramp_current, 40 * b2.ms)
    idx_t_end = int(round(fast_ramp_t_end*0.1*b2.ms / b2.defaultclock.dt))
    voltage_fast = state_monitor.vm[0,idx_t_end]
    print("voltage_fast={}".format(voltage_fast))


Question
~~~~~~~~
Use the function :func:`.HH.plot_data` to visualize the dynamics of the system for the fast and the slow case above. Discuss the differences between the two situations. Why are the two "threshold" voltages different? Link your observation to the gating variables :math:`m`, :math:`n`, and :math:`h`. Hint: have a look at `Chapter 2 Figure 2.3 <Chapter_>`_.


Exercise: Rebound Spike
-----------------------
A HH neuron can spike not only if it receives a sufficiently strong depolarizing input current but also after a hyperpolarizing current. Such a spike is called a *rebound spike*.

Question
~~~~~~~~
Inject a hyperpolarizing step current ``I_amp = -1 uA`` for 20ms into the HH neuron. Simulate the neuron for 50 ms and plot the voltage trace and the gating variables. Repeat the simulation with ``I_amp = -5 uA``  What is happening here? To which gating variable do you attribute this rebound spike?


Exercise: Brian implementation of a HH neuron
---------------------------------------------

In this exercise you will learn to work with the Brian2 model equations. To do so, get the source code of the function  :func:`.HH.simulate_HH_neuron` (follow the link to the documentation and then click on the [source] link). Copy the function code and paste it into your Jupyter Notebook. Change the function name from ``simulate_HH_neuron`` to a name of your choice. Have a look at the source code and find the conductance parameters ``gK`` and ``gNa``.

Question
~~~~~~~~
In the source code of your function, change the density of sodium channels. Increase it by a factor of 1.4. Stimulate this modified neuron with a step current.

* What is the minimal current leading to repetitive spiking? Explain.
* Run a simulation with no input current to determine the resting potential of the neuron. Link your observation to the  Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz voltage equation.
* If you increase the sodium conductance further, you can observe repetitive firing even in the absence of input, why?
