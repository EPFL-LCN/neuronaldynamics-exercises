Python exercise modules
-----------------------

All exercises are contained in subpackages of the python package `neurodynex`.
The subpackages contain modules used for each exercise. The module `neurodynex.tools` provides functions shared
across exercises. Note that the code is not optimized for performance and there is no guarantee for correctness.
